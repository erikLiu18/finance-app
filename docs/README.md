# Design Docs

This folder contains high-level design documents for the Personal Finance app.

Suggested files:
- `architecture.md` – overall system architecture, components, data flow
- `data-model.md` – entities (User, Account, Transaction, Budget), relationships
- `features.md` – feature specs and UX flows
- `roadmap.md` – planned milestones and future work

Keep these documents up to date as the app evolves.
